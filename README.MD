# Newtonian

A small game where you control a ball that moves and collides with other balls using basic physics.

This project is built using **JavaScript** and the **Canvas API** to simulate movement, acceleration, and collision. Itâ€™s a playful and fun experiment to showcase simple physics concepts.
